# Current Mission: Phase 13 - Final Polish & Full Integration

## Objective
The goal is to transition from the current "Mock/Local" storage state to a "Real/Supabase" backend state. The backend infrastructure (FastAPI + Supabase) is already scaffolded and connection-verified.

## Status
- [x] Phase 11: Frontend Storage Abstraction (Complete)
- [x] Phase 12: Backend Scaffolding & Verification (Complete)
- [x] Phase 13: Final Integration (Complete)
- [x] Documentation: Root README (Complete)

## Recent Success
- Successfully connected to Supabase from the backend (`oltcirbrnqzexgxnkemm.supabase.co`).
- Verified `storageService` abstraction works for LocalStorage; ready to toggle to `ApiStorageService`.
- Auth0 token interception is working via `Auth0TokenSync`.
